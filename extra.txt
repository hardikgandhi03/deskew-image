As your page gets more complex you might want to look into more advanced angle calculations
        
         Maybe use the average angle of all contours.
         allContourAngles = [cv2.minAreaRect(c)[-1] for c in contours]
         angle = sum(allContourAngles) / len(allContourAngles)
        
         Maybe take the angle of the middle contour.
         middleContour = contours[len(contours) // 2]
         angle = cv2.minAreaRect(middleContour)[-1]
        
         Maybe average angle between largest, smallest and middle contours.
         largestContour = contours[0]
         middleContour = contours[len(contours) // 2]
         smallestContour = contours[-1]
         angle = sum([cv2.minAreaRect(largestContour)[-1], cv2.minAreaRect(middleContour)[-1], cv2.minAreaRect(smallestContour)[-1]]) / 3
        
         Experiment and find out what works best for your case.
